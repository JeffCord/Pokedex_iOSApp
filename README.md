# Pokedex_iOSApp

An iOS app developed in a group project for a mobile computing class. It utilizes a free API containing data of hundreds of Pokemon and allows the user to search up a specific Pokemon and easily view the important facts and attributes of the requested character, much like the fictional Pokedex device from the franchise.
